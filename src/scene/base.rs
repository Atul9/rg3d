//! Contains all structures and methods to create and manage base scene graph nodes.
//!
//! Base scene graph node is a simplest possible node, it is used to build more complex
//! ones using composition. It contains all fundamental properties for each scene graph
//! nodes, like local and global transforms, name, lifetime, etc. Base node is a building
//! block for all complex node hierarchies - it contains list of children and handle to
//! parent node.
