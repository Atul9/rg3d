//! Contains all structures and methods to create and manage lights.
//!
//! Light sources arte basic building blocks of many scenes in games, it improves
//! perception of scene and makes it look natural. rg3d engine supports three kinds
//! of ligth sources:
//!
//! 1) Directional - similar to sun in real life, its rays are parallel.
//! 2) Spot - similar to flash light, it has cone light volume and circle spot.
//! 3) Point - similar to light bulb, it has spherical light volume.
//!
//! Each kind of light source is suitable for specific conditions, for example
//! spot light can be used if you have a character with flashlight, point - if
//! you have a character with torch, and finally directional - for outdoor light.
//!
//! Most of light sources supports shadows (via shadows maps) and light scattering,
//! these are common effects for modern games but still can significantly impact
//! performance.
